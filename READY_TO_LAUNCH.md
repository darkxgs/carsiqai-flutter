## 🚨 IMPORTANT REMINDERS

- ⚠️ **Never commit** `key.properties` or `.jks` files to git
- ⚠️ **Save passwords** securely (use password manager)
- ⚠️ **Backup keystore** - losing it means you can't update the app
- ⚠️ **Test on real devices** - emulators don't catch everything
- ⚠️ **Read store guidelines** before submitting
