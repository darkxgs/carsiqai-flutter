# Assets Directory

## Splash Logo
Add your splash screen logo as `splash_logo.png` in this directory.

**Recommended specifications:**
- Size: 512x512 pixels
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- Style: Simple, clean design that works on white background

**Current logo needed:**
- File name: `splash_logo.png`
- This will be used for the app splash screen on both Android and iOS

## How to add your logo:
1. Create or export your CarsiqAi logo as a 512x512 PNG
2. Name it `splash_logo.png`
3. Place it in this `assets/images/` directory
4. Run `flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create` to generate splash screens

## Temporary Solution:
If you don't have a logo ready, you can use a simple text-based placeholder or download a car-related icon from:
- Material Icons
- Feather Icons  
- Heroicons

The app will work without the logo, but the splash screen will show a default Flutter logo.
